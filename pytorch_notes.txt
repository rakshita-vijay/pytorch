torch.tensor: multi-dimensional matrix containing elements of the same data type

torch.nn module: contains tools for building neural networks

torch.nn.functional: has functions like activation functions and loss functions

class Model(nn.Module) 
    nn.Module is the base class for all neural network models in PyTorch. 
    By inheriting from it, your class gets all the features needed for a neural network.  

self.fc1 = nn.Linear(in_features, h1):
    Creates the first fully connected (linear) layer. 
    Takes in_features inputs and outputs h1 values (neurons).

relu: rectified linear unit
      common activation f() used in nn, especially deep learning models
      helps the network learn complex patterns by introducing non-linearity (model can learn more than just straight lines or simple relationships)
 
f(x) = max(0, x) 
- If x > 0, output x
- If x <= 0, output 0
